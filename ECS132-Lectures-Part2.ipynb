    "The problem relates to synchronizing 2 sensor nodes while minimizing sensor battery power usage. We consider that time is divided into fixed length frames with each frame containing $n$  fixed length slots. In each frame, each sensor node independently and randomly selects $m$ slots to be awake (and sleeps the remaining $n-m$ slots). Let $P(\\text{match})$ denote the probability that in a frame there is at least one common slot in which both the sensors are awake. We want to find $P(\\text{match})$\n",

    "1. If $m > n/2$ then the $P(\\text{match}) = 1$. This makes sense: if each node selects greater than half of the number of slots then, there will be at least one match. (This is an example of the Pigeonhole principle.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Here the demoninator is the size of the sample space, $\\left| S \\right|$, since the sensors are independent and each one is active in $m$ of the $n$ slots. \n",
    "\n",
    "The numerator is the number of ways the sensors can choose non-overlapping slots.  The first has $n$ slots to choose from, the second has $n-m$ slots to choose from. \n",

    "# IV. Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "We started with the naïve definition of probability and solved some challenging and important problems. We discussed the limitations of the naïve definition and then gave a formal definiton of probability. Now we take the next step to increase the power of probabilistic modeling. In particular, we discuss how we update  the evaluation of the uncertainty (risk) when we are given new data. In a sense this is what we as humans are constantly doing--re-evaluating risk based on data that we sense from the environment.  Conditional probability is also considered the foundation for statistics. \n",

    "In Figure \\@ref(fig:cond) given that event $B$ has occurred the relevant portion of event $A$ is $A \\cap B$. Given that $B$ has occurred, outcomes that are not in $B$ ($B^{\\mathsf(c)}$)are no longer relevant. The sample space has now collapsed to $B$ since only outcomes in $B$ are possible. \n",
